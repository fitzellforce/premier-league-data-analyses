## Long Passes Attempted per 90 vs. Percentage Successfully Completed: Analysis

# Data Cleaning: Separated name column into two name columns: first and last name.
# Data Cleaning: Sometimes players only go by one name. In cases where last name column was null, I duplicated the first name value to fill in the null last name.
# Filtering Data: I filtered out records where the player has played less than 10 full games (10 "90s") and selected only players considered midfielders.

pl.pass.clean <- pl.pass %>% separate(Player, into=c('first','last'),sep=' ', extra="merge")

pl.pass.clean$last[is.na(pl.pass.clean$last)] <- pl.pass.clean$first[is.na(pl.pass.clean$last)]

pl.pass.mids_10_90s <- pl.pass.clean %>% filter (`90sâ–¼`>10 & (Pos == "MF" | Pos == "MF,DF" | Pos == "MF,FW" | Pos == "DF,FW" | Pos == "FW"))



# The two functions below return the mean values for the x and y-axis, which are used to create a horizontal and vertical line, diving the plot into quadrants.

pl.pass.mids_10_90s %>% summarize(mean(Att...21))
pl.pass.mids_10_90s %>% summarize(mean((Cmp...20/Att...21)))



## Scatter Plot Visualization of Long Passes Attempted per 90 vs. Percentage Successfully Completed
# ggplot: from the data frame created above, I chose attempted long passes per 90 as x-axis & long pass completion percent as y-axis
# geom_point: to display a scatter plot
# geom_text_repel: used last name column text as the label for data points that met specific criteria (if every data point was labelled, it would be too crowded)
# xlim: to set x-axis from 0 to 15. Allowed ylim to automatically set itself
# geom_hline and vline: were set to the mean x and y values to create quadrants (calculated in line 47 & 48)
# labs (to create title, subtitle, caption), annotate (to create 4 text labels to describe each quadrant)
# scale_x/y_continuous: set axis names, change unit of y-axis ticks to percent, used pretty_breaks to set number of data ticks across each axis
