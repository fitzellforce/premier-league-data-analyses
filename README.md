## English Premier League Football: Statistical Analysis &amp; Data Visualizations

**Summary:** In this project, I gathered large amounts of stats and data on Fbref.com from the 2022-23 English Premier League Season, then performed data analysis to glean insights on players and teams, and created visualizations to display these findings.

**Methods:** I utilized a variety of softwares and platforms to perform these analyses and produce visualizations. My intention was to demonstrate competency in all the popular tools used for data analysis:
* Spreadsheets (Excel)
* R Programming (RStudio)

**Context:** Having just completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I decided to create an open-ended project that utilizes all the skills I learned throughout the course. Currently, I have only analyzed long passing stats for every player in the league.
